  <h3>My message to The Great Kezia Lazarus of all time üíó</h3>
  <p>Dear beloved Child of God,
    Do not forget the promises God has for you. In his words he said; seek my kingdom and
    my righteousness first and other things will be added unto you (Matthew 6:33).
    I know you are seeking his kingdom and his righteous first but make sure you do not only
    know that other things will be added unto you, UNDERSTAND HOW.</p>
  <p>Let me explain</p>
  <p>The God we serve is a spirit, if you want to worship him you have to do it in spirit and
    in truth (holiness). This means every other thing you do with him must be done in spirit
    and in truth (holiness).
    Because you communicate in spirit, your spirit have a sword (the word of God Ephisians 6:17)
    KNOWING the word of God means you have the sword, UNDERSTANDING the word of God means you
    know how to use the sword.
    The same thing should be applied to your helmet (salvation) and shield (faith).
    Just put those worries aside and underestand your God the more, what you don't know
    about him is far more than what you know about him (Isaiah 55:8-9).</p>
  <p>Henceforth, we would be having a meeting were we would we digesting the word of God together
    on whatsapp. Click the <a href="https://wa.me/2347031552144">link</a> to input your prefered time and days.</p>
